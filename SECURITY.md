## Security Design Notes

- All state-changing functions require explicit `require_auth()` from the relevant party
- Employer cannot withdraw employee funds; employee cannot access unearned funds
- Claimable amount is always capped at `deposit - withdrawn` — no over-payment possible
- Cancel pays employee their earned share first, then refunds employer the remainder
- Paused time is excluded from accrual — `last_withdraw_time` is reset on resume
- All token amounts use `i128` — no floating-point arithmetic
- Stop time is validated to be in the future at stream creation
