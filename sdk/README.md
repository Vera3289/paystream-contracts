# @paystream/sdk

TypeScript SDK for the PayStream Soroban contracts on Stellar.

## Install

```bash
npm install @paystream/sdk @stellar/stellar-sdk
# For browser wallet support:
npm install @freighter-api/freighter-api
```

## Usage

### Read-only queries

```ts
import { PayStreamClient } from "@paystream/sdk";
import { Networks } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const client = new PayStreamClient({
  rpcUrl: "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org",
  networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET,
  contractId: "C...",
});

const stream = await client.getStream(0n);
const claimable = await client.claimable(0n);
const count = await client.streamCount();
```

### Create a stream (with Freighter)

```ts
import { PayStreamClient, connectFreighter, freighterSignTransaction } from "@paystream/sdk";
import { Networks } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const client = new PayStreamClient({ rpcUrl, networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET, contractId });

const employer = await connectFreighter();
const unsignedXdr = await client.createStream(
  employer,
  "G<EMPLOYEE>",
  "C<TOKEN>",
  1_000_000n,   // deposit (stroops)
  100n,          // rate_per_second
  0n,            // stop_time (0 = indefinite)
  0n             // cooldown_period
);
const signedXdr = await freighterSignTransaction(unsignedXdr, Networks.TESTNET);
const txHash = await client.submitTransaction(signedXdr);
```

### Withdraw

```ts
const employee = await connectFreighter();
const xdr = await client.withdraw(employee, 0n);
const signed = await freighterSignTransaction(xdr, Networks.TESTNET);
await client.submitTransaction(signed);
```

### Real-time claimable polling (#104)

```ts
import { pollClaimable } from "@paystream/sdk";

const handle = pollClaimable(client, 0n, 5000, (amount) => {
  console.log("Claimable:", amount.toString());
});

// Stop polling later:
handle.unsubscribe();
```
